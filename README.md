# Rails::Patch::Json::Encode

This is a monkey patch for Rails in order to speed up its JSON encoding, and to draw people's attention to this [Rails issue](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9212). 

For full details please read Jason Hutchens' [blog post](http://devblog.agworld.com.au/post/42586025923/the-performance-of-to-json-in-rails-sucks-and-theres).

All credits goes to [Jason Hutchens](https://github.com/jasonhutchens) for discovering the issue and providing the code for this monkey patch.

## Usage

First, go to your Rails console and type:

    data = Hash.new
    key = 'aaa'
    1000.times { data[key.succ!] = data.keys }
    1000 * Benchmark.realtime { data.to_json }
    
See how Rails performs before the patch.

Then bundle install this gem with a fast JSON encoding gem in your Rails' Gemfile.

    gem 'rails-patch-json-encode'
    gem 'oj'
    
In this case I choose the oj gem, but you can [choose a JSON gem that multi_json supports](https://github.com/intridea/multi_json#supported-json-engines).

Rails should now use the faster encoder. Now restart your console again and re-run the test to see how the performance changes.

The actual performance boost on real-world applications will probably be less than that. For one of my page I see the rendering time dropped by 25%.

## Warning

This gem may break your app. **Test your app**. I am not sure if this is production ready.

## What's with the name

This is just a temporal monkey patch, and a monkey patch isn't supposed to have a fancy name.
